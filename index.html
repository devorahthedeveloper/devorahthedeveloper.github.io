					<h3>Proto (a front end framework)</h3>
					<h4 class="blurb">Reinvented FXCM's approach to front-end development.</h4>
					<div class="tag-container">
						<ul class="tags">
							<li>Object-oriented JavaScript</li>

						<p>Proto is a comprehensive front-end framework and accompanying JavaScript abstraction layer I designed and architected for use on <a href="http://www.fxcm.com" target="_blank">FXCM</a>'s retail sites.</p> 
						<p>In designing Proto for my team, my goal was to build a system of <strong>reusable components</strong> that:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Encouraged consistent code structure, design and site user experience.</li>
							<li>Reduced the time it took to code new web content.</li>
							<li>Empowered all developers, especially junior developers, to build complex functionality.</li>
							<li>Was flexible enough to scale over time and accomodate growing business / technical needs.</li>
						</ol>

						<h5>Division of labor when building Proto</h5>
						<p>I developed Proto's underlying philosophy. This included determining the roster of components (modules) and how they would interact with each other. I also architected the macro grids (a reduced set of generic containers), the page-level grids, file and folder naming conventions, content templates and the methodology for constructing CSS classes. Here, the work of Nicole Sullivan's <a href="http://oocss.org/" target="_blank">OOCSS</a>, Jonathan Snook's <a href="https://smacss.com/" target="_blank">SMACSS</a>, and the <a href="https://en.bem.info/" target="_blank">BEM</a> methodology were illuminating.</p>
						<p>I then divided the coding between myself and the other developers on my team. I chose this method to reinforce the modularity of the framework. We were each responsible for building modules that could stand on their own but shared common interface patterns with the other modules.</p>
						<p>We also built a companion JavaScript abstraction layer for applying common behavior such as modals, video players, ajax forms and accordions, all via CSS classes. And lastly, we built a <a href="http://devorahthedeveloper.com/proto">documentation site</a> to catalogue the system.</p>
						<h5>Results of adopting Proto</h5>
						<p>Within a few weeks of lauching Proto on fxcm.com, we saw metrics improve across the board:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Bounce rate dropped 30-40% on the homepage</li>
							<li>Increase in "site stickiness" by 1-2 pages per user</li>
							<li>21% lift in lead conversions </li>
							<li>Nearly double account conversions</li>
							<li>Time to code standard pages dropped by 70%.</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Replacing special characters</h3>
					<h4 class="blurb">Lightweight JavaScript that identifies and replaces special characters within form submission.</h4>

							<li>JavaScript</li>

						<p>This script enables you to replace special characters within user-collected form data. It can be called within a form submit handler or upon any other event of your choice. </p>

					<div class="additional">
						<h5>Notes:</h5>
						<p>I coded this script to correct an issue with FXCM lead-generation ajax forms. The webservice handling these ajax forms could not process accented characters, and consequently, we were losing valuable leads in countries where accented characters (such as: ç,ü­,æ,ß, etc) are common.</p>
						<p>We didn’t have the option to revise the webservice in the short term, so I built this script to replace problematic characters with predefined safe replacements upon submit. <strong>For example, "<span class="bad">Ü</span>ber­gr<span class="bad">ö­ß</span>e" "becomes "<span class="good">Ue</span>ber­gr<span class="good">oe­ss</span>e"</strong>.</p>
						<p> With the script in place, we saw a lift in conversions.</p>

						<p>View the open-sourced <a href="http://devorahthedeveloper.github.io/replace-special-characters" target="_blank">demo</a> on github. The original script is also still in place on <a href="http://www.fxcm.com/de/forex-kostenloses-demokonto/" target="_blank">FXCM forms</a>.</p>

					<h3>URL tester</h3>
					<h4 class="blurb">Coded a JavaScript app for testing FXCM application URLs</h4>

						<p>I built this app to help the Quality Assurance team at FXCM test application URLs.</p><p> They needed a quick and simple way to construct application URLs, which were long and contained many difficult-to-remember query parameters. Within a few days, the QA team was using the tool regularly. In fact, they found it so useful, they began sharing it with other departments too.</p>

					<div class="additional">
						<h5>Notes:</h5>
						<p>In the open-source <a href="http://devorahthedeveloper.github.io/url-builder" target="_blank">demo</a>, I removed all FXCM-centric content and replaced it with a fictitious menu planner. The demo shows the original functionality but will not construct a real (existing) URL. It's purely proof of concept.</p>

						<p>I coded this light-hearted app as a means of learning <strong>AngularJS</strong>. In it, I make use of all the Angular goodies: directives, isolate scope, route resolving, routeChange &amp; routeError events and factories, among other things.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="additional">
						<h5>Notes:</h5>
						
						<p>I quite like how this app turned out. I've got a few ideas to develop it further, but first, I plan to refactor the application's directory structure using <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide" target="_blank">John Papa's style guide</a> as a starting point. After that I will swap out the native AngularJS router for <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router" target="_blank">UI router</a> to enable better nested views and add a node.js backend + database for data persistence. Lastly, I plan to add social components such as the ability to export faces to share with friends.</p>
						<p><em>Note: No plans to upgrade to Angular 2.0 as of yet, but keeping an eye on the latest developments (Typescript! Web components!)</em></p>
